    "Dash is a library that allows the creation of web apps writing only python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dash uses `flask` under the hood, a well stablished minimalist python web server for the backend and `React` for the frontend. These are great choices that enable developers to create custom components once they got used to all the tools Dash offers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we are talking about MT5 and python but adding interactivity between them may spark some creativity in your mind and encorage you to dig deeper into it.\n",

    "\n",
    "The instructions for the setup of the different `ipython` enviroments can be found here: https://github.com/plotly/jupyter-dash\n",
    "\n",
    "The enviroment requirements may vary depending on which `ipython` interface you are using. I am using the __VSCode__ because it requires almost no setup. Others may require `nodejs` installation.\n",

    "This is the reference to the code editor _extension_ that makes your life easier: ![Jypter extension for VSCode](../images/setup/tutorial_setup_05_vscode_extension.png \"Jypter extension for VSCode\")\n",
